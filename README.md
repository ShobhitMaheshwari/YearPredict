#Year Prediction for Songs

As part of UCSC - CS218 "Deep Learning" class, we wanted to work on The Million Song Dataset [1] of The Echo Nest and LabROSA. Here you can see our attempts at reproducing their results, and trying to improve it.


##Setup
Assuming your machine has ```wget``` and ```unzip```, you can run downloader script by issuing ```. download.sh``` in your terminal. It will download 200MB zip archive, unzip it, and then delete the zip file. Data file (YearPredictionMSD.txt) is added to .gitignore.

This section will be updated with additional setup requirements once the project is completed.


##Results
This section will be updated with our results once the project is completed.
